      <h3>Alice Khin</h3>
      <p> Coding is something that I did as a hobby beforehand, before I realised I could then pursue it as a career. Before Bootcamp, I modded various games I liked playing (primarily just texture replacements), as well as make websites. I've also done pixel art as a small side hobby before, which you may be able to see in my projects below.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Pixel Run</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project consisted of a small game where you move the character between three lanes and avoid enemies. It was made for the 2021 two-week Bootcamp program. This Processing project demonstrates my ability to make classes, for loops, integrate and use external libraries, and more! The background and assets were either coded by me in for loops, or I drew them on another program and put it into Processing, or I borrowed and credited resources from the internet. Animation was done by using framecounts and an external gif library. The clouds and slimes accelerate due to an acceleration variable. The clouds themselves are also randomly generated every time the game starts up. A score was made by using millis(); and only starts counting from when the game is started.
